- [ ] sign the installer and application executable before any public distribution

## Desktop dependency hardening — 2026-08-23

- [x] upgrade Electron, electron-builder and Vite to advisory-free supported releases
- [x] remove the unused deprecated electron-packager release path
- [x] verify dashboard/root builds, supported-contract typecheck and focused Office/operator tests

## Safe Voice Command Room — 2026-08-20

- [x] add a calm desktop HUD with explicit microphone, speaker, local voice and execution states
- [x] keep microphone permission fail-closed and classify browser Web Speech as unverified, not local STT/TTS
- [x] expose a fixed read-only skill allowlist and block shell, writes, installs, deploy and secrets
- [x] require plan -> diff -> approval -> one-shot execute -> receipt, with a session kill switch engaged by default
- [x] represent Markdown memory as preview-only until a separately reviewed local persistence contract exists

This roadmap is the working master plan for turning `Eclipse Hopson Sentinel` into a professional local operator platform under the `Eclipse Hopson` brand.

## Offline Spec Gate verifier - 2026-08-13

- [x] expose sentinel spec verify before the inherited runtime starts
- [x] require the exact approved eclipse.spec-gate.v1 shape while keeping implement blocked
- [x] reject absolute, traversal and .git paths, symlinks, workspace escape and policy escalation
- [x] hash local evidence in read-only mode without network, shell or artifact commands
- [x] cover valid input, traversal and symlink escape with regression tests
- [ ] add semantic evidence evaluators only as separately reviewed, fail-closed plugins
## Strategic priorities

1. make `Sentinel Core` trustworthy for daily coding work
2. make `Sentinel Voice` reliable enough for repeated local use
3. reduce inherited upstream risk through cleanup, testing, and clear contracts
4. create a stable product foundation before chasing advanced assistant features

## Read-only browser and ads operator boundary - 2026-08-02

- [x] add a fail-closed browser capability policy for HTTPS, public, allowlisted, read-only pages
- [x] reject private IPv4/IPv6 destinations, URL credentials, cookie import, external telemetry and all browser mutations
- [x] provide a telemetry-off loopback Camofox-compatible environment contract without installing the community wrapper
- [x] wire the policy into an env-gated `BrowserRead` tool that exposes only disposable create/snapshot/stats/close calls
- [x] add a bounded spend anomaly detector that can only return `notify_only`
- [ ] complete a dedicated container/network security review and real runtime smoke before enabling BrowserRead in production profiles
- [ ] wire notify-only ads anomalies into the production scheduler after the inherited TypeScript baseline is restored

## Secure MCP baseline - 2026-07-29

- [x] add version-pinned `context7`, `filesystem`, and `github-readonly` presets to the real Sentinel MCP CLI
- [x] require one explicit existing directory for Filesystem instead of broad implicit access
- [x] keep GitHub credentials in the process environment and enable read-only, lockdown, and limited toolsets
- [ ] add scheduled tool-description hash verification after the first approved runtime scan

## TypeScript baseline - 2026-07-31

- [x] verify the shipped Bun build and CLI smoke: `0.1.7` builds and reports its version
- [x] verify provider tests: 47 focused tests pass
- [x] measure the inherited strict TypeScript baseline without weakening `tsconfig`: 4,504
      errors across 832 files
- [x] restore schema-derived SDK core/control aliases, normalized usage/settings types,
      build macro declarations, and the ES2023 library contract; strict errors now total
      3,982 (522 fewer) and the restored surface adds no new errors
- [x] make the entire 216-test Bun suite blocking in CI instead of reducing failures to warnings
- [x] add a strict `typecheck:supported` gate for maintained, self-contained Eclipse contracts
- [x] add a reproducible debt audit that fails when the inherited full-program baseline grows
- [ ] restore a fully green `npm run typecheck` as a dedicated XL cleanup track. Start with
      lawful reconstruction of generated/internal message, transport, plugin and wizard contracts,
      then runtime symbols and implicit `any`; do not hide the baseline with broad excludes,
      generated `any` stubs or relaxed strictness

The reproducible 2026-08-13 baseline is 3,995 diagnostics on Windows and 4,291 on Linux CI.
The Windows profile includes 517 `TS2307`
diagnostics across 196 unique missing module specifiers. Build success does not make these errors
acceptable. CI now contains the debt while the strict supported-contract gate protects new Eclipse
work; the baseline must be reduced in reviewed slices and deleted once the full program is green.

## Distribution provenance gate - 2026-07-31

- [x] replace the inaccurate repository-wide MIT claim with a mixed-provenance notice
- [x] mark the npm package private and remove public publish configuration
- [x] disable automatic and manual package updates in the private build so Sentinel cannot
      silently replace itself with Gitlawb/OpenClaude or Anthropic artifacts
- [ ] identify the exact Gitlawb/openclaude commit used by the initial import
- [ ] obtain legal clearance before public redistribution, package publication, sublicensing,
      or sale of the inherited TypeScript CLI
- [ ] record the exact Rust parity import SHA and confirm its license at that revision

## Research intake - 2026-07-31

### Agent capability health

- keep **Agent Reach** as an architecture reference for capability registry, read-only `doctor`,
  visible failure reasons, and deterministic fallback order
- do not install its mutable multi-tool stack, reuse primary browser cookies, or let an agent
  self-install global packages
- any future Sentinel connector registry requires signed/pinned entries, least privilege,
  explicit egress, isolated execution, prompt-injection boundaries, and an audit log
- first design step: render synthetic connector health and a safe next action without making
  network requests

## Research intake - 2026-07-01

Source: [Eclipse Library · July 2026 project integration](https://library.eclipse-forge.ru/#guide/july-2026-project-integration).
These are references and backlog candidates, not implemented capabilities.

### Operator memory

- evaluate **OpenHuman** as a reference for long-lived local operator memory: user habits, cwd/session context, docs/logs, goals, consent scopes, audit trail, and memory deletion
- keep memory local-first by default; remote sync must be opt-in and scoped
- add a future design note for "what the operator can remember" vs "what must stay ephemeral"

### Mobile control plane

- evaluate **OpenClaw Mobile** as a UX reference for remote approval/control: agent proposes action -> user confirms from phone
- require explicit permissions for camera, geolocation, voice, screen context, and command execution
- add a mobile approval mode only after local bridge auth, token rotation, and audit logging are stable

### Model routing

- evaluate **OmniRoute** as a reference for a safe model-router: local/cloud providers, fallback order, context compression, cost/error/latency metrics
- production rule: only legal keys, owned quotas, and ToS-safe providers; no "free token bypass" dependency
- first POC should expose one OpenAI-compatible endpoint with two providers and clear failure logs

## Research intake - 2026-07-13

Source: [Eclipse Library · Applied project plan](https://library.eclipse-forge.ru/#guide/applied-project-plan-2026-07-13).
These items are product directions and safety references, not installed runtime dependencies.

### Agent safety and shell guardrails

- evaluate **Destructive Command Guard** as a pre-command safety layer for autonomous shell actions
- add a local `sentinel doctor safety` concept: risky command detection, safer alternatives, audit output
- never execute destructive command rewrites silently; user confirmation remains mandatory
- [x] pin AgentShield `1.4.0` in the local and CI agent-config security gates instead of executing an unreviewed latest package

### Workstation doctor

- use **privacy.sexy** as a reference checklist for OS/browser telemetry and privacy posture
- use **Fast File Explorer** as a reference for fast file search, preview and checksum UX
- use **NtWarden** only as lab/VM reference for Windows security diagnostics; never require kernel-driver tools for normal users
- [x] ship a standalone read-only Windows Doctor for Secure Boot, TPM, Defender, Firewall, UAC, disk encryption, SMBv1, RDP, Windows Update, restart state, telemetry policy and persistent PowerShell policy
- [x] expose stable `windows-doctor-v1` JSON without device identity, secrets or automatic remediation
- [x] add a dependency-free synthetic self-test and Windows CI gate
- [ ] add a reviewed desktop summary after the existing desktop shell has a stable security boundary; keep every remediation behind an explicit diff and user confirmation

### Voice and live operator

- evaluate **Voicetypr** for local STT and transcript cleanup
- evaluate **Sokuji** for live translation/subtitles and virtual microphone patterns
- evaluate **Fish Audio** only for consent-safe voice/TTS experiments

### Mobile control plane

- use **PCLink** and OpenClaw Mobile patterns for phone approvals: PC proposes action -> phone confirms -> bridge logs the decision
- remote control must require localhost/VPN, auth tokens, rotation, and visible audit trail
- keep **VCamdroid** as a camera-input architecture and permission-UX reference only; do not install its admin DLL/APK/ADB stack on the primary workstation. Any future proof of concept requires a disposable Windows VM, a separate Android device, pinned-source audit and an explicit camera use case.

### Token economy

- use installed Codex skills (`context-compression`, `ponytail-review`, `loopy`, `caveman-compress`) as development workflow helpers
- benchmark `sqz` separately before adopting any dedup/MCP layer
- do not use lossy image-context approaches for code, secrets, migrations or exact logs

### Local model runtime R&D

- use **Colibri** as an architecture reference for disk-streamed MoE local runtimes, not as a default dependency
- extract the `plan` / `doctor` pattern into a future `sentinel doctor model` command: RAM, disk, provider reachability, model path, expected speed and safe next action
- document the reality check clearly: a 744B model can be made runnable on consumer hardware, but cold decode is disk-bound and not a production-speed promise
- see [sentinel-local-model-runtime-rd.md](sentinel-local-model-runtime-rd.md) for the first research contract

## Immediate priorities

### P0: Reliability and unblockers

- install and verify `Bun` in the local environment
- run `npm run build`
- run a smoke test for `Sentinel Core`
- run a smoke test for `/sentinel-bridge`
- run a smoke test for `sentinel-voice`
- document exact runtime requirements for Windows
- fix environment-specific blockers one by one instead of layering new features on top of unstable assumptions

### P0: Voice session hardening

- persist bridge sessions to disk so they survive process restarts
- restore bridge sessions on bridge startup
- add session TTL and cleanup rules
- keep `bridgeSessionId -> sentinelSessionId -> cwd` mappings auditable
- add explicit session inspection output for debugging

### P0: Contracts and diagnostics

- stabilize the `voice-v1` bridge response contract
- version the bridge contract explicitly for future breaking changes
- add request validation for bridge endpoints
- add error codes, not just free-form error strings
- add a formal `voice doctor` output contract
- document known environment blockers in one place

## Sentinel Core improvements

### Build and runtime

- fully validate the TypeScript runtime as the current default engine
- fully validate the Rust runtime as the next-generation engine
- define objective criteria for when Rust becomes the default runtime
- add a runtime capability matrix: TypeScript vs Rust
- remove user-facing inherited names left from upstream layers
- separate experimental code paths from production paths

### Code quality

- add type-safe bridge response models shared across server and clients
- reduce duplicated launch logic across scripts and bin entrypoints
- isolate voice-related helpers behind clean modules instead of growing `bin/sentinel-voice` endlessly
- move PowerShell integration to dedicated helpers with common error handling
- add structured logging around bridge sessions and voice requests
- add consistent error normalization for bridge, TTS, and STT flows

### Security and safety

- enforce localhost-only defaults for bridge
- add optional bridge token rotation
- define safe defaults for command execution and permissions in voice-triggered flows
- ensure voice-triggered actions are auditable before enabling more automation
- review exposed endpoints for input validation and abuse prevention
- explicitly separate trusted local use from future remote-control features

### Tests

- add unit tests for bridge response normalization
- add tests for session lifecycle: create, ask, resume, delete
- add tests for CLI flag parsing in `sentinel-voice`
- add regression tests for empty input, malformed JSON, and unauthorized requests
- add contract tests for `voice-v1`
- add smoke tests for launchers and bridge startup

## Sentinel Voice improvements

### MVP hardening

- persist voice session state across client restarts
- add a voice-specific config file or profile
- support command history and voice history review
- support better interruption and cancel flows
- support a dedicated concise speaking style for TTS responses
- add transcript cleanup and text normalization before TTS

### STT and TTS

- improve TTS voice selection and fallback rules
- add TTS truncation rules for long technical answers
- add optional "brief verbal summary" mode before full response
- improve STT error messages and microphone setup guidance
- add STT language selection and locale profiles
- add confidence-based STT handling
- add a retry option when speech recognition confidence is low

### Push-to-talk and interaction model

- add more ergonomic prompt hints in PTT mode
- add a dedicated PTT state indicator in the terminal UI
- support a "listen again" quick action after failed recognition
- support a "repeat last answer" shortcut
- support an "interrupt speaking" action during TTS
- add "confirm before executing risky actions" for voice-driven commands

### Wake word and background listening

- add a wake-word research spike only after microphone permissions and STT are stable
- evaluate local wake-word engines for Windows compatibility
- keep wake-word mode optional and disabled by default
- add battery and CPU impact measurement before enabling background listening
- add privacy modes: push-to-talk only, wake-word only, fully manual

### Desktop shell

- build a lightweight desktop shell or control panel
- show current session, last action, and microphone/TTS state
- add a compact always-on-top mode
- add quick buttons for listen, repeat, stop, and mute
- add a visual confidence indicator for STT
- add a visual "thinking / working / speaking" state machine

## Jarvis-inspired features to build safely

These are good ideas to borrow conceptually without copying code directly:

- local-first voice workflow
- privacy-first positioning
- voice pipeline separation: wake word -> STT -> router -> action -> TTS
- assistant persona with strong product identity
- desktop presence instead of terminal-only interaction
- better device and environment diagnostics

## Personal operator features

### Coding assistant

- open project and workspace shortcuts
- summarize repositories verbally
- explain code sections verbally and in text
- run project-specific workflows by voice
- create files, drafts, and patch suggestions through safe confirmation steps
- voice shortcuts for review, test, search, and explain

### Local system operator

- open apps and folders
- read notifications or reminders
- run trusted local scripts
- provide status reports about current workspaces
- orchestrate project startup routines
- support scheduled local routines later through automations

### Memory and personalization

- define a durable local memory model
- store preferred voice, language, rate, and speech style
- store preferred coding model profiles
- add per-project context profiles
- add assistant modes such as `Operator`, `Coder`, `Research`, `System`
- add user-confirmable memory updates instead of silent persistence

## Model and provider strategy

- formalize OpenRouter profiles for coding and fast responses
- [ ] Run the network-gated direct Kimi K3 `sentinel` synthetic suite from Eclipse AI Hub twice; record safety score, latency, tokens and cost before considering a provider preset. See [sentinel-kimi-k3-benchmark.md](sentinel-kimi-k3-benchmark.md).
- [ ] Keep TokenRouter rejected until owner, Terms, DPA, routing providers, retention, subprocessors and promotion limits are verified; never use it as a shortcut to the direct benchmark.
- keep Ollama as the offline/local fallback
- add clear provider presets: `fast`, `code`, `voice`, `offline`
- measure latency and quality per provider in voice workflows
- add model routing rules for spoken interactions vs deep coding tasks
- add safer defaults for long-context and voice-oriented exchanges
- integrate [ClawRouter](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter) as smart auto-routing provider (55+ models, <1ms, up to 92% savings)
- integrate [MetaClaw](https://github.com/aiming-lab/MetaClaw) as meta-learning proxy (auto-skills from sessions, no GPU in skills_only mode)

## External integrations

> See [sentinel-integrations.md](sentinel-integrations.md) for full setup guides.

### P1: Zero-code integrations (env vars only)

- ClawRouter — auto-select optimal model by request complexity (`blockrun/auto`)
- MetaClaw — create skills from Sentinel sessions, inject into future prompts (`metaclaw/auto`)

### P2: Adapters required

- [TADA TTS](https://huggingface.co/collections/HumeAI/tada) — replace Windows SAPI with expressive open-source TTS (700s speech, 5x faster)
- [Qwen3-TTS](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS) — Alibaba TTS with Russian support, 49 voices, 97ms latency, voice cloning (TADA alternative)
- [CosyVoice 3](https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/CosyVoice) — 0.5B mini TTS, Russian, zero-shot voice cloning in 3 sec, runs on weak hardware (best for low-resource Sentinel setups)
- [WhisperLiveKit](https://github.com/QuentinFuxa/WhisperLiveKit) — streaming STT with speaker diarization, replaces one-shot STT with continuous WebSocket transcription
- Telegram/Discord bots — remote Sentinel control via messenger, leveraging Bridge API

## Operational excellence

### Documentation

- keep one source of truth for setup
- add a full Windows setup guide for voice prerequisites
- add troubleshooting for microphone privacy, TTS voices, and bridge failures
- add an architecture diagram for `Core`, `Bridge`, and `Voice`
- add a release checklist before each major milestone

### Release discipline

- define milestone tags: `alpha`, `voice-alpha`, `desktop-alpha`, `beta`
- introduce a changelog or release notes discipline
- add quality gates before tagging a release
- require smoke checks before merge to main for major runtime changes

### Observability

- add structured logs for bridge requests and voice actions
- add optional local event traces for debugging
- track latency for STT, bridge, model response, and TTS separately
- track failure rates for microphone, grammar, TTS, and bridge startup

## Professional execution order

### Track A: Stabilize what already exists

- improve TTS and STT ergonomics
- add desktop shell prototype

### Track C: Expand capabilities

- add wake-word research spike
- add desktop presence
- add richer automation
- add memory and personalization
- unify more of the Rust runtime with the production path

## Definition of done for the next serious milestone

The next milestone should not be considered complete until all of the following are true:

- `Sentinel Core` builds locally without manual patching
- `sentinel-bridge` starts reliably
- bridge sessions persist across restarts
- `sentinel-voice` can do text, TTS, STT, and push-to-talk on Windows
- `voice doctor` gives actionable setup information
- known blockers are documented and reproducible
- the main product can be demoed end-to-end without hand-waving
## Operational visual contract pilot - 2026-08-12

- [x] Add a typed, dependency-free `eclipse-forge.visual-system.v1` contract and local JSON snapshot.
- [x] Rebrand the startup status and move the terminal gradient from upstream orange to Eclipse gold -> signal blue.
- [x] Map suggestion, memory and rate-limit progress to the shared signal color.
- [x] Pass the focused contract test and production build. The inherited full TypeScript baseline still fails on missing upstream modules and legacy typing errors.
- [x] Remediate the inherited Bun dependency graph; the 2026-08-13 `bun audit` reports zero advisories, while lifecycle scripts remain blocked and package publishing stays disabled.

### GPT-5.6 fixed-profile rollout — 2026-08-17

- [x] Add fast, balanced, and deep aliases for Luna, Terra, and Sol through the existing Codex Responses transport.
- [x] Keep model choice and reasoning defaults explicit and covered by focused provider tests.
- [ ] Run production-like quality, latency, and usage evals before changing any default or enabling autonomous tools.

## Eclipse Ultron desktop identity — 2026-08-25

### P0 completed

- [x] Introduce Eclipse Ultron as the user-facing desktop product while preserving Sentinel runtime, storage and IPC identifiers.
- [x] Replace the static operator surface with a state-driven Ultron Core: idle, listening, approval, executing, speaking, success and blocked.
- [x] Keep the execution sequence deterministic: command -> plan/diff -> human approval -> one-shot execute -> receipt.
- [x] Add explicit STOP and Motion controls; respect OS reduced-motion and keep core animation to transform/opacity.
- [x] Add fixed local CUDA Whisper one-shot STT through trusted Electron IPC without renderer parameters, shell expansion, OAuth, background recording or transcript persistence.
- [x] Rebrand the application, first-run guide, icon and NSIS artwork to the original Eclipse crimson/graphite/silver system.
- [x] Verify a machine-wide Windows upgrade from Sentinel 1.1.1 to Ultron 1.2.0 in the approved E-drive directory.
- [x] Install the verified portable `whisper.cpp b4938` runtime and `large-v3-turbo-q5_0` model only on the approved E-drive, then pass a real Russian microphone smoke.
- [x] Install portable Ollama 0.32.15 and HuiHui Qwen3.8 27B in an isolated loopback Lab profile with a separate E-drive model store and no tools.

### P1 next

- [ ] Add an in-product download/update verifier for Local AI Runtime; binaries and weights remain outside Git and installer.
- [x] Complete the 27B warm/cold latency pilot: 233.3 s cold load and about 7 tok/s warm generation confirm Lab must remain opt-in chat-only; `qwen3:8b` stays primary.
- [ ] Add an explicit cancellable voice session contract before offering longer capture windows.
- [ ] Add signed Windows releases; an unsigned installer remains local/internal only.
- [ ] Expand Ultron Core beyond read-only only through separate least-privilege capability contracts and visible approval gates.
